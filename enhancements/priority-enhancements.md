- Materiality assessment storage
- Data lineage tracking
- Audit trail tables

### 2. Data Quality Framework
- Validation rules engine
- Completeness checks
- Unit conversion system
- Anomaly detection
- Data stewardship roles

### 3. Regulatory Mapping Engine
- CSRD/ESRS compliance
- XBRL tagging capability
- SEC climate rules
- Framework crosswalks

## PHASE 2: INTEGRATION & AUTOMATION (Weeks 5-8)

### 1. Real Data Connectors
- ERP system APIs
- HR system integration
- Utility data parsing
- IoT sensor feeds
- Supplier portals

### 2. Calculation Engine
- GHG Protocol formulas
- Intensity metrics
- Scope 3 estimation
- Water footprint
- Waste calculations

## PHASE 3: ADVANCED FEATURES (Weeks 9-12)

### 1. Analytics & Intelligence
- Scenario analysis (TCFD)
- Trend forecasting
- Peer benchmarking
- Risk scoring
- Target tracking

### 2. Enhanced Reporting
- Interactive dashboards
- Multi-format exports
- Stakeholder views
- Real-time monitoring
- Assurance support

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:

1. **Expand database schema** - Current schema missing 80% of required tables
2. **Implement data validation** - No quality controls exist
3. **Add regulatory compliance** - Framework mapping insufficient
4. **Build calculation engine** - Basic math only, need GHG Protocol
5. **Create audit trails** - Required for assurance/compliance
6. **Enhance supply chain module** - Missing due diligence features
